# ALGORITHM + INTUITION BUILDING

I will be uploading more LeetCode questions here slowly but surely, focusing on providing **optimised solutions** and showcasing my **logical approach** to solving them.

### What to expect:
- **Optimised Algorithms:** Most solutions will be posted inside the \`optimised algorithms\` folder, focusing on O(n) time complexity.
- **Creative Perspectives:** I will be approaching random techniques to solve basic problems to change people's perspectives and show that **coding is an art of logic and creativity.**
- **Clean Code:** Well-structured and commented C++ code.
- **Logic Breakdowns:** Deep dives into the "why" behind complex problem-solving.

**Happy Coding!**
